django-todo is a pluggable multi-user, multi-group task management and 
assignment application for Django. It can serve as anything from a 
personal to-do system to a complete, working ticketing system for organizations.

IMPORTANT: this fork assumes you have added the jquery-ui css and ui.datepicker.js to your own base template!
